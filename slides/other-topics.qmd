## Misc

* How to get data into orderly in the first place
  - git versioned files
  - git ignored files
  - files from canonical locations
  - databases
* Coping with failure
* Running knitr/rmarkdown
* Getting files out of orderly ([`orderly_copy_files`](https://mrc-ide.github.io/orderly/reference/orderly_copy_files.html){preview-link="true"})

## The right number of packets

* Similar to "how big is a git repo"
* Some issues:
  * People fragmenting packets to overcome flakey analysis
  * Millions of packets, leading to complex and slow queries
  * Hard to get the right combination of packets

## The right number of parameters

* Too few is too inflexible
* Too many becomes annoying quite quickly

## Interaction with git

* Don't save outputs
* Save some inputs?
* Don't save secrets
* Don't save locations
* Git repositories might (or might not) corespond to orderly archives

## Next steps

* Back to the [project root](..)
* Back to [collaboration](collaboration.html)
