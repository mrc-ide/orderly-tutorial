title: "orderly tutorial"
---

This is a site for the [orderly (orderly)](https://mrc-ide.github.io/orderly) tutorial.  There are a series of slide decks designed to run one after another:

1. [Introduction](slides/intro.qmd)
1. [Getting started](slides/getting-started.qmd)
1. [Writing orderly code](slides/orderly-code.qmd)
1. [Collaboration](slides/collaboration.qmd)
1. [Other topics](slides/other-topics.qmd)

During the tutorial we will use some datasets.  You should download these to your computer and copy them around as we build a project.

<!-- It would be nice to bundle these into the quarto site, but I have not looked at how to do that yet. -->
